## Configuring Local Realm Database and Performing CRUD Operations

This React Native app uses Realm for local database storage without specifying a schema. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the setup and operations:

1. **Configuring Realm without a Schema:**
   Realm can be configured without providing a schema. This approach allows for more flexibility in handling data structures, enabling the database to accommodate various object types without predefined models.

2. **CRUD Operations:**
   - **Create:** Add new objects to the Realm database.
   - **Read:** Retrieve and query objects stored in the Realm database.
   - **Update:** Modify existing objects in the Realm database.
   - **Delete:** Remove objects from the Realm database.

3. **Data Storage in Realm:**
   In Realm, data is stored in a table-like structure. By not specifying a schema, data can be stored more flexibly, allowing for dynamic changes to the data model without requiring predefined schemas.

For detailed guidance on handling Realm without a schema, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/device-sdks/sdk/node/realm-files/open-and-close-a-realm/#open-a-realm-without-providing-a-schema).
